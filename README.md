# MatlabShepherding
Matlab Code for Shepherding
This code was initially written to implement Strombom's model for shepherding. It then evolved to structure the code, allowing flexibility to separate the dynamics of an agent from the guidance provided in shepherding, and improving some of the equations in Strombom. A number of publications were then based on this code. A complete list can be found on the website http://swarmshepherding.net/
