# MatlabShepherding
Matlab Code for Shepherding
This code was initially written to implement Strombom's model for shepherding. It then evolved to structure the code, allowing flexibility to separate the dynamics of an agent from the guidance provided in shepherding, and improving some of the equations in Strombom. This code was the model used for the following paper without the path planning optimiser. Please cite this paper if you use this code.
